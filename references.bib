Features appearing most frequently in the models included radiance at 0.727, 0.753, 0.848, 0.870, 0.900 and 0.917μm. The best single predictor of LAI was the absolute difference in radiance between 0.777 and 0.673μm.

In the literature, 350–2500 nm spectra were successfully used to predict soil color and mineralogy, but these attributes currently are not mapped for most Brazilian soils. In this paper, we provided the first large-extent maps with 30 m resolution of soil color and mineralogy at three depth intervals for 850,000 km2 of Midwest Brazil. We obtained soil 350–2500 nm spectra from 1397 sites of the Brazilian Soil Spectral Library at 0–20 cm, 20–60, and 60–100 cm depths. Spectra was used to derive Munsell hue, value, and chroma, and also second derivative spectra of the Kubelka–Munk function, where key spectral bands were identified and their amplitude measured for mineral quantification. Landsat composites of topsoil and vegetation reflectance, together with relief and climate data, were used as covariates to predict Munsell color and Fe–Al oxides, and 1:1 and 2:1 clay minerals of topsoil and subsoil. We used random forest for soil modeling and 10-fold cross-validation. Soil spectra and remote sensing data accurately mapped color and mineralogy at topsoil and subsoil in Midwest Brazil. Hematite showed high prediction accuracy (R2 {\textgreater} 0.71), followed by Munsell value and hue. Satellite topsoil reflectance at blue spectral region was the most relevant predictor (25\% global importance) for soil color and mineralogy. Our maps were consistent with pedological expert knowledge, legacy soil observations, and legacy soil class map of the study region.},

	abstract = {Chromium (Cr) pollution in soil can cause serious harm to both human health and the environment. Cr (Ⅵ) is of particular concern due to its strong carcinogenic, teratogenic, and mutagenic effects on humans. It can also lead to soil hardening and crop yield reduction. Recently, hyperspectral approaches have become a popular way of analyzing heavy metal pollution in soil, and are both convenientand cost-effective, compared with chemical analysis. However, the complex composition of soil makes it challenging to directly analyze the influence of heavy metals on soil spectra and achieve efficient and rapid identification of heavy metal contamination in soil. In this research, a simulation experiment was designed for soil Cr content. Threshold detection-Hilbert-Huang transform (TD-HHT) was implemented to remove the complex environmental noise of soil spectra, to extract the weak heavy metal information. The results showed that the TD-HHT amplitude fluctuates at different Cr concentrations, and heavy metal pollution can be directly detected from the amplitude curve at around 600 mg/kg. To verify this threshold value, the correlation between the soil optical constant and the soil heavy metal concentration was explored through the bidirectional reflectance distribution function, based on the threshold validation-Hapke (TV-Hapke) model. At around 600 mg/kg, Cr can be directly detected using the soil radiative transfer model, which can be utilized to rapidly detect soil heavy metal pollution.},

	abstract = {Quantitative remote sensing of leaf traits offers an opportunity to track biodiversity changes from space. Augmenting field measurement of leaf traits with remote sensing provides a pathway for monitoring essential biodiversity variables (EBVs) over space and time. Detailed information on key leaf traits such as leaf mass per area (LMA) is critical for understanding ecosystem structure and functioning, and subsequently the provision of ecosystem services. Although studies on remote sensing of LMA and related constituents have been conducted for over three decades, a comprehensive review of remote sensing of LMA—a key driver of leaf and canopy reflectance—has been lacking. This paper reviews the current state and potential approaches, in addition to the challenges associated with LMA estimation/retrieval in forest ecosystems. The physiology and environmental factors that influence the spatial and temporal variation of LMA are presented. The scope of scaling LMA using remote sensing systems at various scales, i.e., near ground (in situ), airborne, and spaceborne platforms is reviewed and discussed. The review explores the advantages and disadvantages of LMA modelling techniques from these platforms. Finally, the research gaps and perspectives for future research are presented. Our review reveals that although progress has been made, scaling LMA to regional and global scales remains a challenge. In addition to seasonal tracking, three-dimensional modeling of LMA is still in its infancy. Over the past decade, the remote sensing scientific community has made efforts to separate LMA constituents in physical modelling at the leaf level. However, upscaling these leaf models to canopy level in forest ecosystems remains untested. We identified future opportunities involving the synergy of multiple sensors, and investigated the utility of hybrid models, particularly at the canopy and landscape levels.},

	abstract = {Despite providing vital ecosystem services, wetlands are increasingly threatened across the globe by both anthropogenic activities and natural processes. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) has emerged as a promising tool for rapid and accurate monitoring of wetland extent and type. By acquiring information on the roughness and moisture content of the surface, SAR offers unique potential for wetland monitoring. However, there are still challenges in applying SAR for mapping complex wetland environments. The backscattering similarity of different wetland classes is one of the challenges. Choosing the appropriate SAR specifications (incidence angle, frequency and polarization), based on the wetland type, is also a subject of debate and should be investigated more thoroughly. The geometric distortion of SAR imagery and loss of coherency are other remaining challenges in applying SAR and its processing techniques for wetland studies. Hence, this study provides a systematic meta-analysis based on compilation and analysis of indexed research studies that used SAR for wetland monitoring. This meta-analysis reviewed 172 papers and documented an upward trend in usage of SAR data, increasing usage of multi-sensor data, increasing integration of C- and L- bands over other configurations and higher classification accuracy with multi-frequency and multi-polarized SAR data. The highest number of wetland research studies using SAR data came from the USA, Canada and China. This meta-analysis highlighted the current challenges and solutions for wetland monitoring using SAR sensors.},

	abstract = {Wetlands are one of the most important ecosystems due to their critical services to both humans and the environment. Therefore, wetland mapping and monitoring are essential for their conservation. In this regard, remote sensing offers efficient solutions due to the availability of cost-efficient archived images over different spatial scales. However, a lack of sufficient consistent training samples at different times is a significant limitation of multi-temporal wetland monitoring. In this study, a new training sample migration method was developed to identify unchanged training samples to be used in wetland classification and change analyses over the International Shadegan Wetland (ISW) areas of southwestern Iran. To this end, we first produced the wetland map of a reference year (2020), for which we had training samples, by combining Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 images and the Random Forest (RF) classifier in Google Earth Engine (GEE). The Overall Accuracy (OA) and Kappa coefficient (KC) of this reference map were 97.93\% and 0.97, respectively. Then, an automatic change detection method was developed to migrate unchanged training samples from the reference year to the target years of 2018, 2019, and 2021. Within the proposed method, three indices of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), and the mean Standard Deviation (SD) of the spectral bands, along with two similarity measures of the Euclidean Distance (ED) and Spectral Angle Distance (SAD), were computed for each pair of reference–target years. The optimum threshold for unchanged samples was also derived using a histogram thresholding approach, which led to selecting the samples that were most likely unchanged based on the highest OA and KC for classifying the test dataset. The proposed migration sample method resulted in high OAs of 95.89\%, 96.83\%, and 97.06\% and KCs of 0.95, 0.96, and 0.96 for the target years of 2018, 2019, and 2021, respectively. Finally, the migrated samples were used to generate the wetland map for the target years. Overall, our proposed method showed high potential for wetland mapping and monitoring when no training samples existed for a target year.},

	abstract = {Google Earth Engine (GEE) is a cloud-based geospatial processing platform for large-scale environmental monitoring and analysis. The free-to-use GEE platform provides access to (1) petabytes of publicly available remote sensing imagery and other ready-to-use products with an explorer web app; (2) high-speed parallel processing and machine learning algorithms using Google’s computational infrastructure; and (3) a library of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) with development environments that support popular coding languages, such as JavaScript and Python. Together these core features enable users to discover, analyze and visualize geospatial big data in powerful ways without needing access to supercomputers or specialized coding expertise. The development of GEE has created much enthusiasm and engagement in the remote sensing and geospatial data science fields. Yet after a decade since GEE was launched, its impact on remote sensing and geospatial science has not been carefully explored. Thus, a systematic review of GEE that can provide readers with the “big picture” of the current status and general trends in GEE is needed. To this end, the decision was taken to perform a meta-analysis investigation of recent peer-reviewed GEE articles focusing on several features, including data, sensor type, study area, spatial resolution, application, strategy, and analytical methods. A total of 349 peer-reviewed articles published in 146 different journals between 2010 and October 2019 were reviewed. Publications and geographical distribution trends showed a broad spectrum of applications in environmental analyses at both regional and global scales. Remote sensing datasets were used in 90\% of studies while 10\% of the articles utilized ready-to-use products for analyses. Optical satellite imagery with medium spatial resolution, particularly Landsat data with an archive exceeding 40 years, has been used extensively. Linear regression and random forest were the most frequently used algorithms for satellite imagery processing. Among ready-to-use products, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was used in 27\% of studies for vegetation, crop, land cover mapping and drought monitoring. The results of this study confirm that GEE has and continues to make substantive progress on global challenges involving process of geo-big data.},

	abstract = {Numbers of Earth Observation (EO) satellites have increased exponentially over the past decade reaching the current population of 1193 (January 2023). Consequently, EO data volumes have mushroomed and data storage and processing have migrated to the cloud. Whilst attention has been given to the launch and in-orbit environmental impacts of satellites, EO data environmental footprints have been overlooked. These issues require urgent attention given data centre water and energy consumption, high carbon emissions for computer component manufacture, and difficulty of recycling computer components. Doing so is essential if the environmental good of EO is to withstand scrutiny. We provide the first assessment of the EO data life-cycle and estimate that the current size of the global EO data collection is {\textasciitilde}807 PB, increasing by {\textasciitilde}100 PB/year. Storage of this data volume generates annual CO2 equivalent emissions of 4101 t. Major state-funded EO providers use 57 of their own data centres globally, and a further 178 private cloud services, with considerable duplication of datasets across repositories. We explore scenarios for the environmental cost of performing EO functions on the cloud compared to desktop machines. A simple band arithmetic function applied to a Landsat 9 scene using Google Earth Engine (GEE) generated CO2 equivalent (e) emissions of 0.042–0.69 g CO2e (locally) and 0.13–0.45 g CO2e (European data centre; values multiply by nine for Australian data centre). Computation-based emissions scale rapidly for more intense processes and when testing code. When using cloud services such as GEE, users have no choice about the data centre used and we push for EO providers to be more transparent about the location-specific impacts of EO work, and to provide tools for measuring the environmental cost of cloud computation. The EO community as a whole needs to critically consider the broad suite of EO data life-cycle impacts.},

	abstract = {Timely and accurate access to regional scale crop plant area and spatial distribution is essential for regional agricultural production and food security, especially in the context of global population growth and climate change. Deep learning has become prevalent in crop mapping under complex conditions due to its powerful feature extraction and nonlinear ability. This study proposes a time-series image classification framework using Attention-based Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (A-BiGRU) to map rice, maize, and soybean in Fujin, China, from reconstructed Sentinel-2 time-series images. Firstly, the reconstructed Sentinel-2 time-series images with 10 spectral dimensions and 22 temporal dimensions were obtained by linear interpolation and Savitzky-Golay (SG) filter. Then, a neural network, the A-BiGRU was developed to identify different crops by taking advantage of their unique growth patterns. The attention mechanism enables temporal neural networks to focus on the critical growth periods of crops. Additionally, the structure of GRU is simpler than that of long short-term memory (LSTM) and simple recurrent neural network (SRNN), which reduces the number of parameters and alleviates overfitting. Compared to GRU, BiGRU can fully uses the time-series information of the entire crop growth cycle. To assess the effectiveness of the proposed method, we compared two deep learning methods (LSTM and SRNN) and three widely used non-deep learning classifiers (Spectral Angle Mapping (SAM), Support Vector Machine (SVM)) and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost). The results demonstrate that A-BiGRU achieved the highest accuracy, with an overall accuracy of 0.9804, a macro F1 score of 0.9788 and a kappa score of 0.9714. We also selected four typical regions and compared the classification results with optical images, which showed that the proposed method has a good recognition effect. Therefore, the A-BiGRU method is capable of achieving high-precision crop mapping.},

	abstract = {Recently, classification using multiple classifier system (MCS) has been reported as an effective method to improve remote sensing (RS) image classification. Such systems provide a complementary mechanism to use multiple classifiers, which have shallow architecture to solve the same classification problem; however, the system exhibits shortcomings due to complex ensemble strategy. Deep learning (DL) has been proven to be an advanced method for complex data classification; however, how to use its advantages to overcome the shortcomings of MCS in ensemble strategy for classification accuracy improvement is worthy of study. Thus, with the multiple classifier mechanism and DL architecture, we propose a novel RS image classification framework, namely, deep–shallow learning (DSL), to improve classification accuracy. The DSL framework consists of a shallow learning (SL) layer and a DL layer. The SL layer contains various classifiers with shallow architecture, which can output different classification results for a certain input, whereas the DL layer is formed by DL networks, which can continue learning from the outputs of the SL layer. DSL simulates a human thinking model that continuously learns from the existing learnings to improve learning efficiency. In our experiment, three shallow classification algorithms, i.e., C4.5, k-nearest neighbor, and naive Bayesian, are used to train base classifiers in the SL layer, whereas a deep belief network (DBN) is used to train the DL layer.

However, differences in local lighting conditions between two acquisitions can lead to differences in image reflectance, which in turn can bias the displacement estimate, especially in the sub-pixel domain. Data-driven methods may provide a way to overcome these errors. From the generation of a realistic simulated database based on Landsat-8 satellite image pairs with added simulated sub-pixel shifts, we developed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) able to retrieve sub-pixel displacements.},

	abstract = {Decision makers require timely and exact delineation of landslide information for effective and quick response to a co-seismic or rainfall-triggered calamity. Remote sensing (RS) techniques provide prompt disaster responses on a local to regional scale, particularly in remote, isolated, and inaccessible places. These techniques, which are divided into pixel, sub-pixel, and object-based techniques, each have their own set of advantages and disadvantages. This study aims to investigate and evaluate the virtues and drawbacks of pixel, sub-pixel, and Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA)-based approach for detecting co-seismic landslides in Muzaffarabad, Pakistan (Lesser Himalayas). Using SPOT and ASTER imagery, a comparison of classification techniques based on the MLC (Maximum Likelihood Classifier), the Co-Registration of Optically Sensed Images and Correlation (COSI-Corr), and the OBIA was performed. On SPOT-5 images, MLC and OBIA approaches were applied, while ASTER images were used for sub-pixel classification. Overall accuracy for pixel-based MLC is 80.8, 90.9\% for the sub-pixel COSI-Corr method, and 91.4\% for OBIA. As a result, it can be inferred that COSI-Corr and OBIA-based classification outperformed the pixel-based MLC classification technique. The OBIA result is more spatially consistent than the pixel-based outcomes with speckled pixel effects, and depending on visual interpretation. Due to varied geomorphic conditions, the OBIA's ruleset makes it difficult to apply in different terrains. The COSI-Corr technique uses low-cost satellite data with a medium resolution to produce a plausible output. For this technique to work, suitable pre- and post-seismic event images (optical and digital elevation model) must be available (free of shadows and clouds).},

	abstract = {With the development of remote sensing satellites, the data quantity of remote sensing image is increasing tremendously, which brings a huge workload to the image geometric rectification through manual ground control point (GCP) selections. GCP database is one of the effective methods to cut down manual operation. The GCP loaded from database is generally redundant, which may result in a rectification slowdown. How to automatically optimize these ground control points is a problem that should be resolved urgently. According to the basic theory of geometric rectification and the principle of GCP selection, this paper deeply comprehends some existing methods about automatic optimization of GCP, and puts forward a new method of automatic optimization of GCP based on voronoi diagram to filter ground control points from the overfull ones without manual subjectivity for better accuracy. The paper is organized as follows: First, it clarifies the basic theory of remote sensing image multinomial geometric rectification and the arithmetic of how to get the GCP error. Second, it particularly introduces the voronoi diagram including its origin, development and characteristics, especially the creating process. Third, considering the deficiencies of existing methods about automatic optimization of GCP, the paper presents the idea of applying voronoi diagram to filter GCP in order to complete automatic optimization. During this process, it advances the conception of single GCP's importance value based on voronoi diagram. Then by integrating the GCP error and GCP's importance value, the paper gives the theory and the flow of automatic optimization of GCPs as well. It also presents an example of the application of this method. In the conclusion, it points out the advantages of automatic optimization of GCP based on the voronoi diagram.},

Over the past decades, growing amount and diversity of methods have been proposed for image matching, particularly with the development of deep learning techniques over the recent years. However, it may leave several open questions about which method would be a suitable choice for specific applications with respect to different scenarios and task requirements and how to design better image matching methods with superior performance in accuracy, robustness and efficiency. This encourages us to conduct a comprehensive and systematic review and analysis for those classical and latest techniques. Following the feature-based image matching pipeline, we first introduce feature detection, description, and matching techniques from handcrafted methods to trainable ones and provide an analysis of the development of these methods in theory and practice. Secondly, we briefly introduce several typical image matching-based applications for a comprehensive understanding of the significance of image matching. In addition, we also provide a comprehensive and objective comparison of these classical and latest techniques through extensive experiments on representative datasets. Finally, we conclude with the current status of image matching technologies and deliver insightful discussions and prospects for future works.

To address this issue, this paper proposes a simple yet effective heterogeneous model fitting (MIMF) for multi-source image correspondences. First, a multi-orientation phase consistency model is constructed, which fuses phase consistency, image amplitude and orientation to detect the correct correspondences of feature points. This model effectively reduces the influence of NRDs. Second, sub-region grids and orientation histograms are exploited to construct the log-polar descriptors with variable-size bins, which are robust to GDs. Finally, a heterogeneous model fitting method is proposed, which can effectively estimate the parameters of the transformation model for alleviating the influence of outliers. Experiments are performed on six public datasets and one constructed dataset containing ten types of multi-source images, and the experimental results show that the proposed MIMF method outperforms several state-of-the-art competing methods in terms of matching performance.},

PubMed, Scopus and Google Scholar databases were searched. In total, results from 71 research papers were summarized qualitatively. In Poland, increased air pollution levels are linked to increased general and respiratory disease mortality rates, higher prevalence of respiratory diseases, including asthma, lung cancer and COVID-19 infections, reduced forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC). The proximity of high traffic areas exacerbates respiratory health problems. People living in more polluted regions (south of Poland) and in the winter season have a higher level of air pollution awareness. There is an urgent need to reduce air pollution levels and increase public awareness of this threat. A larger number of multi-city studies are needed in Poland to consistently track the burden of diseases attributable to air pollution.},

	abstract = {Air pollution is a major driver of climate change. Anthropogenic emissions from the burning of fossil fuels for transportation and power generation emit large amounts of problematic air pollutants, including Greenhouse Gases (GHGs). Despite the importance of limiting GHG emissions to mitigate climate change, detailed information about the spatial and temporal distribution of GHG and other air pollutants is difficult to obtain. Existing models for surface-level air pollution rely on extensive land-use datasets which are often locally restricted and temporally static. This work proposes a deep learning approach for the prediction of ambient air pollution that only relies on remote sensing data that is globally available and frequently updated. Combining optical satellite imagery with satellite-based atmospheric column density air pollution measurements enables the scaling of air pollution estimates (in this case NO\$\_2\$) to high spatial resolution (up to \${\textbackslash}sim\$10m) at arbitrary locations and adds a temporal component to these estimates. The proposed model performs with high accuracy when evaluated against air quality measurements from ground stations (mean absolute error \${\textless}\$6\${\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}mu g/m{\textasciicircum}3\$). Our results enable the identification and temporal monitoring of major sources of air pollution and GHGs.},

	abstract = {Plastic pollution poses a significant environmental threat to the existence and health of biodiversity and the marine ecosystem. The intrusion of plastic to the food chain is a massive concern for human health. Urbanisation, population growth, and tourism have been identified as major contributors to the growing rate of plastic debris, particularly in waterbodies such as rivers, lakes, seas, and oceans. Over the past decade, many studies have focused on identifying the waterbodies near the coastal regions where a high level of accumulated plastics have been found. This research focused on using high-resolution Sentinel-2 satellite remote sensing images to detect floating plastic debris in coastal waterbodies. Accurate detection of plastic debris can help in deploying appropriate measures to reduce plastics in oceans. Two unsupervised (K-means and fuzzy c-means (FCM)) and two supervised (support vector regression (SVR) and semi-supervised fuzzy c-means (SFCM)) classification algorithms were developed to identify floating plastics. The unsupervised classification algorithms consider the remote sensing data as the sole input to develop the models, while the supervised classifications require in situ information on the presence/absence of floating plastics in selected Sentinel-2 grids for modelling. Data from Cyprus and Greece were considered to calibrate the supervised models and to estimate model efficiency. Out of available multiple bands of Sentinel-2 data, a combination of 6 bands of reflectance data (blue, green, red, red edge 2, near infrared, and short wave infrared 1) and two indices (NDVI and FDI) were selected to develop the models, as they were found to be most efficient for detecting floating plastics. The SVR-based supervised classification has an accuracy in the range of 96.9–98.4\%, while that for SFCM and FCM clustering are between 35.7 and 64.3\% and 69.8 and 82.2\%, respectively, and for K-means, the range varies from 69.8 to 81.4\%. It needs to be noted that the total number of grids with floating plastics in real-world data considered in this study is 59, which needs to be increased considerably to improve model performance. Training data from other parts of the world needs to be collected to investigate the performance of the classification algorithms at a global scale.},
