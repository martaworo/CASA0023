# Introduction {.unnumbered}

Hello!

My name is Marta, I am currently pursuing a master degree of Social and Geographic Data Science. My hallmark is the global outlook which I developed while studying and working in Chile, Spain, Poland and the UK. Coming from management, economics and finance background, I am happy to return to academia, aiming to leverage my practical experience in making a wider societal impact.
