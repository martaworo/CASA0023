	abstract = {This study used simple multiple regression to model urban leaf area index (LAI) in Terre Haute, Indiana, USA as a function of AISA+ hyperspectral radiance and its derivative features. Regression R2 values ranging from 0.27 to 0.73 were obtained from the various models. Features appearing most frequently in the models included radiance at 0.727, 0.753, 0.848, 0.870, 0.900 and 0.917μm. The best single predictor of LAI was the absolute difference in radiance between 0.777 and 0.673μm. The best models performed well at low and intermediate LAI levels, but were less accurate with LAI values between 5.0 and 8.0.},

	abstract = {Soil color and mineralogy are used as diagnostic criteria to distinguish different soil types. In the literature, 350–2500 nm spectra were successfully used to predict soil color and mineralogy, but these attributes currently are not mapped for most Brazilian soils. In this paper, we provided the first large-extent maps with 30 m resolution of soil color and mineralogy at three depth intervals for 850,000 km2 of Midwest Brazil. We obtained soil 350–2500 nm spectra from 1397 sites of the Brazilian Soil Spectral Library at 0–20 cm, 20–60, and 60–100 cm depths. Spectra was used to derive Munsell hue, value, and chroma, and also second derivative spectra of the Kubelka–Munk function, where key spectral bands were identified and their amplitude measured for mineral quantification. Landsat composites of topsoil and vegetation reflectance, together with relief and climate data, were used as covariates to predict Munsell color and Fe–Al oxides, and 1:1 and 2:1 clay minerals of topsoil and subsoil. We used random forest for soil modeling and 10-fold cross-validation. Soil spectra and remote sensing data accurately mapped color and mineralogy at topsoil and subsoil in Midwest Brazil. Hematite showed high prediction accuracy (R2 {\textgreater} 0.71), followed by Munsell value and hue. Satellite topsoil reflectance at blue spectral region was the most relevant predictor (25\% global importance) for soil color and mineralogy. Our maps were consistent with pedological expert knowledge, legacy soil observations, and legacy soil class map of the study region.},

	abstract = {Chromium (Cr) pollution in soil can cause serious harm to both human health and the environment. Cr (Ⅵ) is of particular concern due to its strong carcinogenic, teratogenic, and mutagenic effects on humans. It can also lead to soil hardening and crop yield reduction. Recently, hyperspectral approaches have become a popular way of analyzing heavy metal pollution in soil, and are both convenientand cost-effective, compared with chemical analysis. However, the complex composition of soil makes it challenging to directly analyze the influence of heavy metals on soil spectra and achieve efficient and rapid identification of heavy metal contamination in soil. In this research, a simulation experiment was designed for soil Cr content. Threshold detection-Hilbert-Huang transform (TD-HHT) was implemented to remove the complex environmental noise of soil spectra, to extract the weak heavy metal information. The results showed that the TD-HHT amplitude fluctuates at different Cr concentrations, and heavy metal pollution can be directly detected from the amplitude curve at around 600 mg/kg. To verify this threshold value, the correlation between the soil optical constant and the soil heavy metal concentration was explored through the bidirectional reflectance distribution function, based on the threshold validation-Hapke (TV-Hapke) model. At around 600 mg/kg, Cr can be directly detected using the soil radiative transfer model, which can be utilized to rapidly detect soil heavy metal pollution.},

	abstract = {Quantitative remote sensing of leaf traits offers an opportunity to track biodiversity changes from space. Augmenting field measurement of leaf traits with remote sensing provides a pathway for monitoring essential biodiversity variables (EBVs) over space and time. Detailed information on key leaf traits such as leaf mass per area (LMA) is critical for understanding ecosystem structure and functioning, and subsequently the provision of ecosystem services. Although studies on remote sensing of LMA and related constituents have been conducted for over three decades, a comprehensive review of remote sensing of LMA—a key driver of leaf and canopy reflectance—has been lacking. This paper reviews the current state and potential approaches, in addition to the challenges associated with LMA estimation/retrieval in forest ecosystems. The physiology and environmental factors that influence the spatial and temporal variation of LMA are presented. The scope of scaling LMA using remote sensing systems at various scales, i.e., near ground (in situ), airborne, and spaceborne platforms is reviewed and discussed. The review explores the advantages and disadvantages of LMA modelling techniques from these platforms. Finally, the research gaps and perspectives for future research are presented. Our review reveals that although progress has been made, scaling LMA to regional and global scales remains a challenge. In addition to seasonal tracking, three-dimensional modeling of LMA is still in its infancy. Over the past decade, the remote sensing scientific community has made efforts to separate LMA constituents in physical modelling at the leaf level. However, upscaling these leaf models to canopy level in forest ecosystems remains untested. We identified future opportunities involving the synergy of multiple sensors, and investigated the utility of hybrid models, particularly at the canopy and landscape levels.},
