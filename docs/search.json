    "text": "1.1 Summary\nBefore the Sun’s energy reaches the Earth’s surface, following interactions happen: absorption, transmission and scattering. The energy transmitted is then either absorbed by the surface material or reflected. The reflected energy is subject to scattering and absorption in the atmosphere before reaching the remote sensor. Atmospheric scattering occurs when the particles or gaseous molecules present in the atmosphere cause the EM radiation to be redirected from its original path. The amount of scattering depends on several factors including the wavelength of the radiation, the amount of particles and gases, and the distance the radiant energy travels through the atmosphere. Three types of scattering:\n-Rayleigh scattering – electromagnetic radiation interacts with particles that are smaller than the wavelengths of light -&gt; it disturbs RS in the visible spectral range from high altitudes. Due to Rayleigh scattering the shorter wavelengths are overestimated. It diminishes the ‘crispness’ of photos -&gt; has a negative effect on digital classification using data from multispectral sensors.\n-Mie scattering – occurs when the wavelength of the EM radiation is similar in size to the atmospheric particles (e.g. aerosols, a mixture of gases, water vapour, dust). Influences the spectral range from near-UV up to mid-IR, and has a greater effect on radiation of longer wavelengths that Rayleigh scattering\n-Non-selective scattering – occurs when the particle size is much larger that the radiation wavelength. For example, water droplets and larger dust particles. The most characteristic example is that we see clouds as white bodies. Important: clouds pose a great limitation – remote sensors cannot see through them, and they cast shadows."

    "text": "1.2 Applications\nSince electromagnetic energy is partly absorbed by various molecules in the atmosphere, such as ozone, water vapour, and carbon dioxide, it may be concluded that many of the wavelegths are not useful for remote sensing of Earth’s surface, due to the corresponding energy not being able to penetrate the atmosphere. According to (Tempfli2009?) only the spectrum portions can be used for remote sensing, they are referred to as atmospheric transmission windows.\nDue to solar energy being reflected differently based on surface characteristics, remote sensors are able to collect information which can reflect characteristics of vegetation since its properties can be detected dues to differences in energy reflection. The amount of energy reflected for a particular wavelength depends on leaf pigmentation, leaf thickness and composition (cell structure), and on the amount of water in the leaf tissue. Optical remote sensing can provide information about the type of plant and about its health condition. Similarly, this can be applied for different types of soil too. For example, iron dominated soil has a significantly different reflectance curve, due to the iron absorption. In conclusion, different forms of radiant energy allows to determine information regarding terrain surface."

Answer lies in scattering of sunlight. Due to difference in wave sizes, blue light is visible since it travels as shorter and smaller waves. This changes when the Sun gets lower in the sky, its light passes through more of the atmosphere, allowing the reds and yellows to pass straight through to our eyes."

We use geometric correction (we identify points in a satellite image, and true image, e.g. open street map (true representation of earth). Ground control point is this location in image X, and find it on image Y. Then we do linear regression with distorted image, and with gold standard data. Or pick coordinates, and track them in original image. From Gold to EO. The more control points, the lower the error will be. We may need to resample the grid -&gt; nearest neighbour\nAtmospheric correction – haze or scattering; adjacency effect – pixels bleeding into other pixels; two ways to remove effects of atmosphere: o Relative - Dark object subtraction (DOS) or histogram adjustment; Psuedo-invariant Features (PIFs). o Absolute (definitive) – done through atmospheric radiative transfer models or empirical line correction – using a field spectrometer, and the you do linear regression between these values. Path radiance (radiance reflected above the surface), atmospheric attenuation (absorption of EMR due to materials in atmosphere)\nOrthorectification correction – subset of georectification Georectification = giving coordinates to an image Orthorectification = removing distortions… making the pixels viewed at nadir (straight down) Atmospheric correction has to be done before topographic correction Radiometric Calibration - sensors capture image brightness and distributed as a Digital Number (or DN) - allows for efficient storage but has no units! Sensor calibration = linear regression; DN to spectral radiance; radiance might also be called Top of Atmosphere (TOA) radiance. We can remove the effects of the light source to generate Top of Atmosphere reflectance but usually this is combined within the radiance to reflectance step. Radiance – when light is on. Reflectance is when light is off. Reflectance is a property of a material (e.g. reflectance of grass is a property of grass) Bottom of Atmosphere vs Top of Atmosphere Assumptions: If/ But • All of the light leaving the surface goes straight to the sensor (nothing is intercepted or at an angle) = hemispherical reflectance • We need to account for atmospheric and illumination effects to create reflectance. BUT this typically doesn’t deal with shadows and directional effects (e.g. viewing angles) = apparent reflectance However, this is often called reflectance Landsat ARD – Analysis Ready Data – there are algorithms that prepare data but they are not perfect, what are the assumptions, influences. But fairly good, no reflected values Level 2 product – means something has changed or advanced from level 1.\n\nJoining data sets/ enhancements In remote sensing it is termed Mosaicking. If our study area is between two tiles, we do join. Before we clip data, we generate a seamline – 10 pixels from both tiles, overlap, and apply histogram matching algorithm. Enhancements - Contrast enhancement – image stretch -&gt; sort of clipping histogram - Other: Ratio, Filtering, PCA, PCA2, Texture (first order,"

This is in line with national spatial policy for Warsaw to raise the rank in the network of European Union cities as one of sustainable economic, social development and protection of natural heritage.  Precisely, this is to adhere the policy of The Real Urban Emissions (TRUE) Initiative which is a partnership of the FIA Foundation and the International Council on Clean Transportation with an aim of restricting access to polluting cars and improving urban air quality.\nSince the air pollution is among the major environmental health risks globally, causing almost 4.5 million premature deaths in 2019 (reference), the transportation sector, which is the leading source of this problem, should be addressed with additional consideration. Vehicle emissions standards are currently successfully controlled, however they tend to differ during real-world operation quite significantly. For this reason, the use of remote sensors can come as a useful tool allowing policy makers to make informative decisions."

    "text": "4.2 Applications\nRemotely sensed data can provide the insight into the actual vehicles emissions across the streets of Warsaw. Being able to measure the emissions under real driving conditions allow to produce an accurate emissions assessment across urban areas. By combining data from sensors with other, already existing databases, it would be possible to analyse long-term trends and gain a better understanding of emissions of the vehicle fleet. This could lead to a comprehensive analysis, allowing to identify high-emitting vehicle groups, comparing the impact of different ambient conditions, and assessing how emission performance change with the vehicle’s age. Most importantly, this could help to inform the design of aforementioned low emission zones by pointing out which vehicle types would have the most impact on emissions reduction should they be restricted from the zone.\nThe estimation of air pollution can be approached as a supervised computer vision problem. Datasets can be collected from Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-5P, spatially and temporally aligned with measurements from air quality monitoring stations. The proposed model can be trained on pairs of remote sensing input and air quality target values (see Figure 1), which yields a system that predicts air pollution levels solely from globally available remote sensing data.\n\n\n\nFigure 1"
