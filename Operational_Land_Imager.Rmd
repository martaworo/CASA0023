# Overview and Mission


Operational Land Imager (OLI)
is an advanced sensor that is used on Landsat 8 and Landsat 9 satellites built by the Ball Aerospace & Technologies Corporation. 
It is a push broom type of sensor that plays a crucial role in Earth observation and remote sensing. 

It has a five-year design life. 

The entire Earth falls within view once every 16 days.

# How does it work?

* Measures in the visible, near infrared, and short wave infrared portions of the spectrum as well as a panchromatic band
* Its images have 15-meter (49 ft.) panchromatic and 30-meter multi-spectral spatial resolutions along a 185 km (115 miles) wide swath, covering wide areas of the Earth’s landscape while providing sufficient resolution to distinguish features like urban centers, farms, forests and other land uses. 
* It has a four-mirror telescope and 12-bit quantization

# Push Broom  Scanner

A push broom scanner, also known as an along-track scanner, is a device for obtaining images with spectroscopic sensors. The scanners are regularly used for passive remote sensing from space, and in spectral analysis on production lines, for example with near-infrared spectroscopy used to identify contaminated food and feed.[1] The moving scanner line in a traditional photocopier (or a scanner or facsimile machine) is also a familiar, everyday example of a push broom scanner. Push broom scanners and the whisk broom scanners variant (also known as across-track scanners) are often contrasted with staring arrays (such as in a digital camera), which image objects without scanning, and are more familiar to most people.

In orbital push broom sensors, a line of sensors arranged perpendicular to the flight direction of the spacecraft is used. Different areas of the surface are imaged as the spacecraft flies forward. A push broom scanner can gather more light than a whisk broom scanner because it looks at a particular area for a longer time, like a long exposure on a camera. One drawback of push broom sensors is the varying sensitivity of the individual detectors. Another drawback is that the resolution is lower than a whisk broom scanner because the entire image is captured at once.

# More Specifications

OLI’s design is an advancement in Landsat sensor technology and uses an approach demonstrated by the Advanced Land Imager sensor flown on NASA’s experimental EO-1 satellite. Instruments on earlier Landsat satellites employed scan mirrors to sweep the instrument fields of view across the surface swath width and transmit light to a few detectors. The OLI instead uses long detector arrays, with over 7,000 detectors per spectral band, aligned across its focal plane to view across the swath. This “push-broom” design results in a more sensitive instrument providing improved land surface information with fewer moving parts. With an improved signal-to-noise ratio compared to past Landsat instruments, OLI is more reliable and provides improved performance.

# Requirements

Maintaining continuity with the data archive placed significant constraining requirements on OLI. Spectrally and spatially, the spectral bands and ground sample distance (GSD) needed to match the existing data sets. OLI also had to be accurately radiometrically calibrated in a method traceable to National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), so it could be on the same scale as other remote sensing data sets and previous Landsat missions. Finally, its images needed to be geolocated well enough to allow direct comparison at the pixel level between data taken with OLI and data taken years ago.

# Applications

The images and data that OLI has helped collect have practical applications today in:
* agriculture
* mapping
* monitoring changes in snow, ice, and water
