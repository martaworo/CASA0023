```

Unfortunatelly, when my Xaringan presentation is embedded on Quarto it is loosing all of the theme I applied and some of the images, even though they are stored in the exactly same location as other images that are showing up. I tried to resolve this issues with TAs, however mission was unsuccessful :c Please find a bit more pretty slides attached below:
