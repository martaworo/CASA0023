## Summary

Implementation of low emission zone in Poland's capital, Warsaw, is due to take place from July 2024. It intends to ban an entry for diesel engine cars older than 18 years and gasoline vehicles older than 27 years. This initiative is in line with national spatial policy for Warsaw to raise the rank in the network of European Union cities as one of sustainable economic, social development and protection of natural heritage. Precisely, this is to adhere the policy of The Real Urban Emissions (TRUE) Initiative which is a partnership of the FIA Foundation and the International Council on Clean Transportation with an aim of restricting access to polluting cars and improving urban air quality.

In line with the World Bank report, out of 50 most polluted cities in the EU, 36 are located in Poland [@worldbank19]. For this reason, initiatives aiming to relieve this matter are of the utmost importance. It has been concluded by @nazar_air_2022 that in Poland, increased values of air pollution are linked with the general increase of respiratory disease mortality rates, higher prevalence of respiratory diseases (e.g. asthma, lung cancer, COVID-19 infections), reduced forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC). Therefore, the proximity of high traffic zones has an influence on respiratory health problems. There is an urgent need to reduce air pollution levels.

Warsaw is among one of the most polluted cities in the European Union and it has one of the highest vehicle ownership rates (859 per 1,000 people) in Europe [@statista_motorization_2021]. Vehicle emissions standards are currently successfully controlled in Warsaw, however they tend to differ during real-world operation quite significantly. For this reason, the use of remote sensors can come as a useful tool allowing policy makers to make informative decisions.

## Applications

Remotely sensed data can provide the insight into the actual vehicles emissions across the streets of Warsaw. Being able to measure the emissions under real driving conditions allow to produce an accurate emissions assessment across urban areas. By combining data from sensors with other, already existing databases, it would be possible to analyse long-term trends and gain a better understanding of emissions of the vehicle fleet. This could lead to a comprehensive analysis, allowing to identify high-emitting vehicle groups, comparing the impact of different ambient conditions, and assessing how emission performance change with the vehicle's age. Most importantly, this could help to inform the design of aforementioned low emission zones by pointing out which vehicle types would have the most impact on emissions reduction should they be restricted from the zone.

### Suggested Methodology

The estimation of air pollution can be approached as a supervised computer vision problem as consulted with @scheibenreif_estimation_2021. Datasets can be collected from Sentinel-2, along with measurements from air quality monitoring stations. The proposed model can be trained on pairs of remote sensing input and air quality target values (see Figure 1) to produce a prediction of air pollution level.

## Reflection

Remote sensing data can support policy of introduction of low emission zone in Warsaw in order to ensure informed decisions regarding zone's boundaries and to facilitate a gentle introduction of the zone itself. Especially considering the fact that public consultation were met with a big protest from citizens and numerous local councils. For this reason, being able to ensure negative impact of transport on the urban environment is actually reduced, stands as a crucial part of policy introduction.
